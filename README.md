# Coast2Coast
Coast2Coast Azure Deployment Project


This repository automates Azure infrastructure deployment using Terraform and GitHub Actions while incorporating Network Security Groups (NSGs) as part of the deployment. It provisions two virtual networks—one in the East and one in the West coast Azure regions—along with virtual machines in each network. Additionally, it configures NSGs to control communication between resources, ensuring network security. Ideal for showcasing multi-region deployments, network resilience, and security in Azure.
